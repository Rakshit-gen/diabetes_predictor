# Diabetes Predictor

This Python program, built using the `scikit-learn` library, aims to predict the chances of an individual having diabetes based on various factors. The program utilizes linear regression and label encoding techniques to create a predictive model.

## Requirements

To run the Diabetes Predictor program, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- scikit-learn library (version 0.24 or above)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the Diabetes Predictor program.
2. Run the program using the following command:

   ```
   python diabetes_predictor.py
   ```

3. The program will prompt you to provide inputs for various factors used in the prediction process, such as smoking history, blood glucose level, and h1bac level. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the necessary information.
4. Once you have provided all the required inputs, the program will predict the chances of having diabetes and display the result on the screen.

## Understanding the Output

The output of the Diabetes Predictor program will be a numerical value representing the predicted chances of an individual having diabetes. The higher the value, the higher the likelihood of diabetes.

## Customization

If you wish to customize or extend the program, you can modify the following files:

- `diabetes_predictor.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the implementation of the diabetes prediction model. You can modify the code to incorporate additional factors or adjust the model's parameters as per your requirements.

## Dataset

The Diabetes Predictor program uses a pre-existing dataset for training and prediction. The dataset contains information about various factors that may contribute to the development of diabetes.
